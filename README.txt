Group Collaboration Review (Ryan Joiner)
---------------------------------------
Despite spending many many hours on this cursed project,
my goals for what I was to produce fell shockingly short
of reality. Constantly switching design ideas and failing
to find the right solutions to the requirements were the
main experiance for me.

My partner for the project spent as much but probably more
time on this endeavour than I. She was responsible for
much of the ingenuity and completed material.

I think that the work load balance was about a 35%(Ryan)
to 65% (Emma) ratio.
